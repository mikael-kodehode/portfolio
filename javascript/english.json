      "description": "My name is Mikael Odegaard. After working with customers for over 2500 working hours I have adopted great skill in professional communication and servicing customers. Due to my generation growing up with technology I started loving computer gaming when I was 5 years old. Through my childhood my dad loved to make Excel sheets with schedules and lists, forms and models with me so I naturally started making them myself when I got my first laptop at 13. At my former workplace I created systems with Excel for us to be more effective and organized. "

      "description": "I have coded on and off since 2016, but I started for real in 2021 when I joined a course by Jobloop (thank you). In 2016 I started with HTML5 and CSS3 self teaching which was hard, but fun. However during the course with Jobloop my interests swung towards Javascript and Python. I am clearly more of a programmer than a designer, but I can still work with CSS. Especially CSS and JS together."
